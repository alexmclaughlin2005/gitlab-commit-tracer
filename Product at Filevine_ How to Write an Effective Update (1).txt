What Is Product’s Role
How to Write an Effective Update


Product managers are the bridge between engineering execution and business needs. As far as updates are concerned, your core responsibility is translating technical progress into information the business can act on.
You own the narrative - Engineering updates focus on implementation details. Your updates focus on customer impact and business readiness.

You protect leadership's time - Leaders shouldn't need to dig through Slack threads, GitLab issues, or ask follow-up questions to understand where things stand.

You enable confident commitments - Sales, Customer Success, and executives rely on your updates to make promises to customers and prospects.

What Leadership Needs to Know
How to Write an Effective Update


Our leaders spend a large amount of their time in meetings with customers and prospects, answering critical questions about our product including new and upcoming features. When a customer asks, "When can we get Feature X?" or a prospect says, "We need Y capability before we sign," leaders need to answer confidently on the spot.
Your updates should answer these questions:

Where are we? - Current state and progress

When is it available? - Timeline for customer use, what will be delivered and what impact will it have

Can we commit? - Demo-ready? Safe to promise to customers?

Assumptions You Should Make
How to Write an Effective Update


When writing your update, assume:


Readers may not remember your update from last week - Don't assume context carries over. Each update should stand on its own and be quickly digestible.

We don't know which customer someone is talking to - They might be on a call with an enterprise prospect, a longtime customer, or a potential partner. Your update needs to work for any scenario.

Others outside of Product may see these updates - Other departments may reference these. Write for a broad business audience, not just product/engineering insiders.
